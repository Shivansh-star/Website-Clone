🌐 Website Clone Project
Welcome to my first project — a website clone built using HTML and CSS!

🚀 About This Project
This is a front-end clone of a well-known website (e.g., YouTube, Netflix, Amazon, etc.), created as part of my learning journey in web development. It focuses on layout structure, styling, and responsiveness using just HTML and CSS.
